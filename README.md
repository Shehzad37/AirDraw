# AirDraw
Gesture based interaction systems are becoming more and more popular both at workplace and home. Our project was to develop a drawing application that can recognize hand gestures which can be used to interact with the system to draw whatever you want just like the good old Paint application. Microsoft Visual C# was used for the implementation of the code with combination of Kinect SDK and opencv Libraries.

# Features

* Interactive Menu to select different drawing tools.
* Smooth Drawing.
* Simple Gestures.
* Draw by sitting or standing it will work on either way.

# Usage

# Requirements
* Kinect SDK
* opencv
* Coding4fun toolkit
